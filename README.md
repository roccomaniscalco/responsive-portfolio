# Responsive Portfolio


## Description

With mobile internet access becoming more prevalent than ever, it is crucial to build with a mobile-first mentality. This project's objective was to create a digital portfolio that is responsive and readable from any viewport.

By using media queries, a website can determine the viewport size and restructure its components accordingly. The responsive portfolio focuses on layouts at the 992px, 768px, and 400px mark.
